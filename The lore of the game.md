#Back Lore (pre war time lore to get a feel for the races)
Lizard folk:
	The lizard folk try to live in solitude with primative technology. They are shamanistic in nature and have lived on the planet since its existance. The only other race that could be considered older than them would be the treants. They have lived isolated and in peach with the other races until recently. The shamanistic rituals they have conducted have attracted the attention of the dryads. By burning and minipulating nature the dryads have taken affront and thus want to eleminate the lizard folk. While the lizard folk do not want to go into war with the dyads, the dryads have taken war to them. 

Orcs:
	While the orcs may not talk like intellectuals the orcs are by far the most scientifically advanced race. Building massive war machines and ships that can transport troops to the other side of the planet in one day. The orcs wish for nothing more than the advancement of scientific discovery. However they feel that they are held back by the lesser races and their constant attacks against the orcs. Thus have declared war on the lesser races deaming them an affront to scientific advancement. Meanwhile the top orc scientests are looking further into leaving the world to find newer discoverys.
