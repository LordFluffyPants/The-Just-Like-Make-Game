Game Mechanics and Design

The goal of the game is to create a challenging strategy game. The way the game will work is an advance war meets warcraft style gameplay.  The win condition of the game will be to destroy the opponents HQ.  Gameplay will be the same of the advance war series with different changes to make the game unique and fun.  Some of the changes include different races rather than a commander, and the biggest addition is the hero unit, which will take over the role of the commander in advance war.  The Hero character will spawn on the map at the beginning of a match which will allow the capturing of various resources.  Capturing resources will allow for the creation of multiple types of units. From the HQ the player will be able to create basic infantry, a “worker unit”.  The HQ will also provide research upgrades (still debating on that).  The worker unit will be able to create different buildings based on HQ level that will allow the creation of other units other than basic infantry (starcraft / warcraft style).  Maps will have nodes that will allow the capturing of various resources which will allow for unit creation. 

Fleshing out the game world

The plan is to have multiple races in the game up to six different ones to create a diverse play style.  The races that have been discussed and decided on are the following:
Human
Elven
Orc
Dryads
Lizard Folk
Goblin


The overarching setting for the game world is something along the lines of fantasy modern.  While the setting is fantasy modern the races will have various technological advances.  These technological advances will not be along the lines of shadowrun technology but more around the middle ground of what we have now and warhammer 40k. 
Each race will have a specific overarching design idea that spans the technological field. 
In a general sense the humans will be the “most” technological advanced while the dryads will be the “least” advanced. The reason for the quotation marks is because wile the races will be balanced technological disparity will be an element of fleshing out the game world.  The dryads for example will not have guns and will be more druid like in nature but are able to command the nature around them to do the exact same things as the humans.  This will discussed more in the balance section of the game but as a design perspective technological disparity will be major factor in the development of the six races.

Hey also the commanding general for the Dryads will be a deer. Like an actual deer with a hat on. Doesn't actually talk just bleats at you.'
